# *Shark*Card
## Plastic credit card bypass tool / lock slipping card

The *Shark*Card is a bypass tool based on the classic credit card bypass. Ideal for slipping locks on doors, this card fits in your wallet and is made from the same tough material that credit cards are made from. The SharkCard makes an ideal shim or shove-it tool for latch loiding. Loiding uses a thin piece of plastic to slide between the latch and the strike plate in order to be able to open the door. This method will work on spring latches and dead latches where the dead latch extends into the opening of the strike plate.

This is an affordable alternative to metal tools which attract more attention. The *Shark*Card is priced to be a tool that you can ditch if you need to, and have a spare for your next engagement.
