## Welcome to *Red*7eam!

We are a company dedicated to providing affordable and high-quality red team physical penetration testing tools for security professionals. Our mission is to empower organizations to identify and address vulnerabilities in their physical security systems.

Our company was founded when one of our pentesters didn't want to take his favourite tool on an engagement because it was too expensive and he didn't want it to get broken. This experience highlighted the need for affordable and durable physical penetration testing tools that security professionals could rely on.

We saw an opportunity to fill this gap in the market and set out to create a line of tools that were both affordable and built to last. We brought together a team of experienced security professionals who were passionate about staying up-to-date on the latest trends and techniques in the field. With their expertise and our dedication to quality, we have been able to build products that meet the needs of red teamers and security professionals.

Our team is comprised of experienced security professionals who have a passion for staying up-to-date on the latest trends and techniques in the field. We are constantly researching and developing new tools to ensure that we are able to offer the best products possible to our customers.

In addition to our product line, we also offer training and consulting services to help organizations improve their physical security posture. Our team has a wealth of experience in the industry and is ready to help you identify and address any vulnerabilities in your systems.

Thank you for considering Red7eam for your physical security needs. We look forward to working with you to keep your organization safe and secure.
